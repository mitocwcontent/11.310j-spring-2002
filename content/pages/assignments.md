Each student will come up with two proposals for Web sites, each designed to serve as a resource for the transfer of knowledge and future planning in the Mill Creek and Brightwood/Northend neighborhoods, respectively. In the last month of the semester, each student will collaborate on the implementation of one of these proposals.

For further background on the project, see the [WPLP](http://web.mit.edu/wplp/index.html) Web site. The WPLP Web site has received millions of hits since it first went online in Spring of 1996.

Course Requirements
-------------------

Work for the semester will be evaluated in five ways:

| ACTIVITIES | PERCENTAGES |
| --- | --- |
| Participation in Class | 15% |
| A Journal, to be turned in weekly via email | 15% |
| A Proposal for Mill Creek | 15% |
| A Proposal for Springfield | 15% |
| A Final Project | 40% 

There will be no final exam. Ongoing work and final project will be posted online. A knowledge of web-authoring and geographic information systems (GIS) is not a prerequisite, but is highly desirable. For those who have no background in web-authoring, there are online classes available through MIT.
